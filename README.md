# Computer-Vision-Geometric-Transformation

The aim is to apply a suitable geometric transformation in an image , in order to form an image of size 1000 Ã— 1000 such that it contains only the object we want, and that with its sides coinciding with the boundaries of the image. First we ask the user for the points that correspond to the 4 corners of the object. We do this by displaying the image, and asking the user to click on the corners of the object (with right clicking). Then we align the image with the right trasformation, for been shown properly in the screen.
